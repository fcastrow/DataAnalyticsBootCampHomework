Data Analytics Boot Camp: Homework Assignment #1, Excel
1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
a.	Plays are very popular in terms of number of campaigns. (32% of all campaigns)
b.	Goals above $45K tend to be less successful. (21% percentage successful)
c.	Music has a high success rate (77% successful).

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?
a.	We are not graphing the goal or pledge data directly, just the number and percentage of the state (fail, canceled, successful, live)
b.	We are not looking at the relationships with number of backers
c.	We are not given the criteria for the determination of state.

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a.	We could look at the relationships between number of backers and category or number of backers and state of the campaign.
