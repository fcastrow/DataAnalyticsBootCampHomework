1.	Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?<br>
a.	Plays are very popular in terms of number of campaigns. (32% of all campaigns)<br>
b.	Goals above $45K tend to be less successful. (21% percentage successful)<br>
c.	Music has a high success rate (77% successful).

2.	What are some limitations of this dataset?<br>
a.	We are not graphing the goal or pledge data directly, just the number and percentage of the state (fail, canceled, successful, live)<br>
b.	We are not looking at the relationships with number of backers<br>
c.	We are not given the criteria for the determination of state.

3.	What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?<br>
a.	We could look at the relationships between number of backers and category or number of backers and state of the campaign.
